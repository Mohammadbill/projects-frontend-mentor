### What I learned

I'd got into the habit of just putting everything in unordered lists, so this was a good one to break me out that habit. This works well, but I'm not sure how I'd do the staggering with more than three items... Maybe through JavaScript?

### Continued development

I'm still looking for a way to get the footer to "flex" itself to the bottom of the page. In the end I just got irritated with it and deleted it - something for the next challenge!
