## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

General CSS practice, but more specifically think I'm starting to get the hang of Flexbox.

### Continued development

- Couldn't get the images to stay in a fixed position. Need to get better at this kind of placement.
- More flexbox practice. Also could this be refactored to use CSS Grid? What are the pros and cons of Flexbox vs CSS Grid? When to use each?

### Useful resources
