## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Really getting the hang of Flexbox now, the first project where I didn't (although it's only a small thing) spend ages trying to get the container and footer positioned correctly.

### Continued development

Need to get those transitions smoother.
