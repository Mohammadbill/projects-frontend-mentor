## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Bit that was hardest about this challenge was getting the image sizes right (responsively). Not sure I'm 100% there, but definitely starting to get the feel for it.

Also quite pleased with my solution for switching through the testimonials, as more can be added without any change to the Javascript (just whack them into the HTML).

### Continued development

Need to do more work on image-heavy challenges to work on this a bit.
