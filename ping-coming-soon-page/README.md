## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SASS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

That was a hard one!! The JavaScript part was relatively simple coming from someone who had done little JS pieces (mostly in GTM) and has a good grasp of Python, but its the impact on the page and how these things can interact in (for a newbie) unpredictable ways that really got me.

Working out how to deal with CSS elements which had more than one class is probably what stumped me the most. I'm getting there but definitely something to work on more....

### Continued development

Going to make an effort to take advantage of CSS class lists, and how they work in SASS, as this is something that I got stumped by for a while here...
