## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SASS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Mainly just revising the fundamentals and cementing what I'd learnt about CSS Grid in the last challenge, but [this Kevin Powell video on ems and rems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI) was useful in getting the different font sizes in different divs more uniform.

### Continued development

Surprisingly the CSS Grid part I didn't really find too challenging. The button styling is the bit that really got me. Asking for feedback on how to fix this, which I guess will dictate what I need to work on next..

I think there's probably more cool / advanced stuff I could do with box shadows and the button animation as well. Lets see.
