## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was the first time I'd used CSS Grid (and I think it shows!). Must be a better way to go about it than all the media queries I wrote. Hoping to get some guidence on that.

### Continued development

The next project I pick will be quite a CSS Grid heavy one I think, this is definitely an area I need to improve in.

Aside from that this was just a good way to practice on the fundamentals and build on the last challenge.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks.com article on CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/) - Despite the title of the article, I did end up using media queries (a lot of them!). Probably not the best way of going about it!
