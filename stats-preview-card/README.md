## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

This was more of a revision of previous concepts, with the exception of background image components, which I still can't seem to get 100% right. ~350px screen width and below it breaks a little bit. Need to look into how to get this running ok.....
